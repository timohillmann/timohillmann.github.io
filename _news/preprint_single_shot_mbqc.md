Last year I spent a couple of months as a visitin researcher at Xanadu in Toronto. I wanted to use that time to finally properly understand fault-tolerant MBQC. Digging in the literature I found that previous works didnâ€™t fit my style of thinking. We ended up recasting foliation in terms of the hypergraph product, enabling us to use the machinery of homology to analyse foliated codes. This proved to be very useful for understanding single-shot error correction in mbqc and also for understanding stability experiments in higher-dimensional topological codes and their implications for lattice surgery. See the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12963) for more!
