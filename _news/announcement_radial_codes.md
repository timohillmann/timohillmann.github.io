Together with Thomas R. Scruby and Joschka Roffe we have proposed a new family of quantum LDPC codes which we call _quantum radial codes_.
These codes are based on a family of classical quasi-cyclic LDPC codes and have a high-threshold, low-overhead, and are single-shot decodable under a circuit-level noise model.
Find out more in our [preprint][https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14445] on the arXiv.
