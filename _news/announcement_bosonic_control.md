Our paper on _Universal control of a bosonic mode via drive-activated native cubic interactions_ has been published in [Nature Communications][https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46507-1].
This completes a join from theory to experiment, where we demonstrate the control of a bosonic mode in a superconducting circuit using native cubic interactions.
