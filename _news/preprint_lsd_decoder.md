We are happy to release LSD to the masses! Localized statistics decoding (LSD) is a reliability-guided inversion decoder that is highly parallelizable and applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity-check codes. Our approach employs a parallel matrix factorization strategy, which we call _on-the-fly elimination_, to identify, validate, and solve local decoding regions on the decoding graph.
Read more about the details in our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18655) or check out the [code](https://github.com/quantumgizmos/ldpc_v2) on GitHub.
