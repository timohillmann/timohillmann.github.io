Quantum error correction is crucial for scalable quantum information processing applications. Traditional discrete-variable quantum codes that use multiple two-level systems to encode logical information can be hardware-intensive. An alternative approach is provided by bosonic codes, which use the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information.
In this project, my co-authors and I investigate the performance of bosonic quantum error correction protocols. We focus on the performance of bosonic codes in the presence of realistic noise models, and on the development of new error correction protocols and decoders with a focus on the utilization of analog information.
