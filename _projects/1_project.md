The availability of non-linearities provided through the Josephson junction is superconducting circuits is a key ingredient for the realization of quantum information processing devices. However, the non-linearities provided by the Josephson junction are typically accompanied by a Kerr non-linearity, which is detrimental for the performance of quantum error correction protocols. 

In the larger scope of this project, my co-authors and I investigate the possibility of achieving universal control of a bosonic mode without the presence of a static Kerr non-linearity. We show that this is possible by balancing the even- and odd-order nonlinearities of the Superconducting Asymmetric Nonlinear Element (SNAIL).
This project started with a theory proposal published in Physical Review Letters and has recently been completed with the experimental realization of the proposed scheme. The experimental results have been published in nature communications.
