  abstract = {Quantum error correction is crucial for scalable quantum information-processing applications. Traditional discrete-variable quantum codes that use multiple two-level systems to encode logical information can be hardware intensive. An alternative approach is provided by bosonic codes, which use the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of harmonic oscillators to encode quantum information. Two promising features of bosonic codes are that syndrome measurements are natively analog and that they can be concatenated with discrete-variable codes. In this work, we propose novel decoding methods that explicitly exploit the analog syndrome information obtained from the bosonic qubit readout in a concatenated architecture. Our methods are versatile and can be generally applied to any bosonic code concatenated with a quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of quasi-single shot protocols as a novel approach that significantly reduces the number of repeated syndrome measurements required when decoding under phenomenological noise. To realize the protocol, we present the first implementation of time-domain decoding with the overlapping window method for general QLDPC codes and a novel analog single-shot decoding method. Our results lay the foundation for general decoding algorithms using analog information and demonstrate promising results in the direction of fault-tolerant quantum computation with concatenated bosonic-QLDPC codes.}

  abstract = {Linear bosonic modes offer a hardware-efficient alternative for quantum information processing but require access to some nonlinearity for universal control. The lack of nonlinearity in photonics has led to encoded measurement-based quantum computing, which relies on linear operations but requires access to resourceful ('nonlinear') quantum states, such as cubic phase states. In contrast, superconducting microwave circuits offer engineerable nonlinearities but suffer from static Kerr nonlinearity. Here, we demonstrate universal control of a bosonic mode composed of a superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element (SNAIL) resonator, enabled by native nonlinearities in the SNAIL element. We suppress static nonlinearities by operating the SNAIL in the vicinity of its Kerr-free point and dynamically activate nonlinearities up to third order by fast flux pulses. We experimentally realize a universal set of generalized squeezing operations, as well as the cubic phase gate, and exploit them to deterministically prepare a cubic phase state in 60 ns. Our results initiate the experimental field of polynomial quantum computing, in the continuous-variables notion originally introduced by Lloyd and Braunstein.},

  abstract = {Continuous-variable systems realized in high-coherence microwave cavities are a promising platform for quantum information processing. While strong dynamic nonlinear interactions are desired to implement fast and high-fidelity quantum operations, static cavity nonlinearities typically limit the performance of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes. Here we study theoretical models of nonlinear oscillators describing superconducting quantum circuits with asymmetric Josephson-junction loops. Treating the nonlinearity as a perturbation, we derive effective Hamiltonians using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. We support our analytical results by numerical experiments and show that the effective Kerr-type couplings can be canceled by an interplay of higher-order nonlinearities. This can be better understood in a simplified model supporting only cubic and quartic nonlinearities. Our results show that a cubic interaction allows an increase in the effective rates of both linear and nonlinear operations without an increase in the undesired anharmonicity of an oscillator which is crucial for many bosonic encodings.},

  abstract = {Quantum low-density parity-check codes are a promising candidate for fault-tolerant quantum computing with considerably reduced overhead compared to the surface code. However, the lack of a practical decoding algorithm remains a barrier to their implementation. In this work, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a reliability-guided inversion decoder that is highly parallelizable and applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity-check codes. Our approach employs a parallel matrix factorization strategy, which we call on-the-fly elimination, to identify, validate, and solve local decoding regions on the decoding graph. Through numerical simulations, we show that localized statistics decoding matches the performance of state-of-the-art decoders while reducing the runtime complexity for operation in the sub-threshold regime. Importantly, our decoder is more amenable to implementation on specialized hardware, positioning it as a promising candidate for decoding real-time syndromes from experiments.},

  abstract = {Bosonic quantum error-correcting codes offer a viable direction towards reducing the hardware overhead required for fault-tolerant quantum information processing. A broad class of bosonic codes, namely rotation-symmetric codes, can be characterized by their phase-space rotation symmetry. However, their performance has been examined to date only within an idealistic noise model. Here, we further analyze the error-correction capabilities of rotation-symmetric codes using a teleportation-based error-correction circuit. To this end, we numerically compute the average gate fidelity, including measurement errors into the noise model of the data qubit. Focusing on physical measurement models, we assess the performance of heterodyne and adaptive homodyne detection in comparison to the previously studied canonical phase measurement. This setting allows us to shed light on the role of different currently available measurement schemes when decoding the encoded information. We find that with the currently achievable measurement efficiencies in microwave optics, bosonic rotation codes undergo a substantial decrease in their break-even potential. In addition, we perform a detailed analysis of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes using a similar error-correction circuit that allows us to analyze the effect of realistic measurement models on different codes. In comparison to RSB codes, we find for GKP codes an even greater reduction in performance together with a vulnerability to photon-number dephasing. Our results show that highly efficient measurement protocols constitute a crucial building block towards error-corrected quantum information processing with bosonic continuous-variable systems.},

The squeezed-cat code, a nonlocal encoding in phase space based on squeezed coherent states, is an example of a noise-biased (bosonic) qubit with exponential error bias. Here we propose and analyze the error correction performance of a dissipatively stabilized squeezed-cat qubit. We find that for moderate squeezing the bit-flip error rate gets significantly reduced in comparison with the ordinary cat qubit while leaving the phase-flip rate unchanged. Additionally, we find that the squeezing enables faster and higher-fidelity gates.}

Such a universal set has been first proposed in quantum-optical setups, but its experimental implementation has remained elusive in that domain due to the difficulties in engineering strong nonlinearities. Here, we show that a realistic three-wave mixing microwave architecture based on the superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element [Frattini et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 110, 222603 (2017)] allows us to overcome this difficulty. As an application, we show that this architecture allows for the generation of a cubic phase state with an experimentally feasible procedure. This work highlights a practical advantage of microwave circuits with respect to optical systems for the purpose of engineering non-Gaussian states and opens the quest for continuous-variable algorithms based on few repetitions of elementary gates from the continuous-variable universal set.},

In simulations of circuit-level noise, we observe comparable error suppression to surface codes of similar distance while using approximately five times fewer physical qubits. This is true even when radial codes are decoded using a single-shot approach, which can allow for faster logical clock speeds and reduced decoding complexity. We describe an intuitive visual representation, canonical basis of logical operators and optimal-length stabiliser measurement circuits for these codes, and argue that their error correction capabilities, tunable parameters and small size make them promising candidates for implementation on near-term quantum devices.},
