  abstract = {Continuous-variable systems realized in high-coherence microwave cavities are a promising platform for quantum information processing. While strong dynamic nonlinear interactions are desired to implement fast and high-fidelity quantum operations, static cavity nonlinearities typically limit the performance of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes. Here we study theoretical models of nonlinear oscillators describing superconducting quantum circuits with asymmetric Josephson-junction loops. Treating the nonlinearity as a perturbation, we derive effective Hamiltonians using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. We support our analytical results by numerical experiments and show that the effective Kerr-type couplings can be canceled by an interplay of higher-order nonlinearities. This can be better understood in a simplified model supporting only cubic and quartic nonlinearities. Our results show that a cubic interaction allows an increase in the effective rates of both linear and nonlinear operations without an increase in the undesired anharmonicity of an oscillator which is crucial for many bosonic encodings.},

  abstract = {Bosonic quantum error-correcting codes offer a viable direction towards reducing the hardware overhead required for fault-tolerant quantum information processing. A broad class of bosonic codes, namely rotation-symmetric codes, can be characterized by their phase-space rotation symmetry. However, their performance has been examined to date only within an idealistic noise model. Here, we further analyze the error-correction capabilities of rotation-symmetric codes using a teleportation-based error-correction circuit. To this end, we numerically compute the average gate fidelity, including measurement errors into the noise model of the data qubit. Focusing on physical measurement models, we assess the performance of heterodyne and adaptive homodyne detection in comparison to the previously studied canonical phase measurement. This setting allows us to shed light on the role of different currently available measurement schemes when decoding the encoded information. We find that with the currently achievable measurement efficiencies in microwave optics, bosonic rotation codes undergo a substantial decrease in their break-even potential. In addition, we perform a detailed analysis of Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes using a similar error-correction circuit that allows us to analyze the effect of realistic measurement models on different codes. In comparison to RSB codes, we find for GKP codes an even greater reduction in performance together with a vulnerability to photon-number dephasing. Our results show that highly efficient measurement protocols constitute a crucial building block towards error-corrected quantum information processing with bosonic continuous-variable systems.},

  abstract = {Noise-biased qubits are a promising route toward significantly reducing the hardware overhead associated with quantum error correction. The squeezed-cat code, a nonlocal encoding in phase space based on squeezed coherent states, is an example of a noise-biased (bosonic) qubit with exponential error bias. Here we propose and analyze the error correction performance of a dissipatively stabilized squeezed-cat qubit. We find that for moderate squeezing the bit-flip error rate gets significantly reduced in comparison with the ordinary cat qubit while leaving the phase-flip rate unchanged. Additionally, we find that the squeezing enables faster and higher-fidelity gates.}

  abstract = {We provide an explicit construction of a universal gate set for continuous-variable quantum computation with microwave circuits. Such a universal set has been first proposed in quantum-optical setups, but its experimental implementation has remained elusive in that domain due to the difficulties in engineering strong nonlinearities. Here, we show that a realistic three-wave mixing microwave architecture based on the superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive element [Frattini et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 110, 222603 (2017)] allows us to overcome this difficulty. As an application, we show that this architecture allows for the generation of a cubic phase state with an experimentally feasible procedure. This work highlights a practical advantage of microwave circuits with respect to optical systems for the purpose of engineering non-Gaussian states and opens the quest for continuous-variable algorithms based on few repetitions of elementary gates from the continuous-variable universal set.},

Such a device possesses a sweet spot in which the external magnetic flux allows to suppress the Kerr interaction. We have excited photons near this Kerr-free point and characterized the device using a transmon qubit. The excitation spectrum of the qubit allows to observe photon-number-dependent frequency shifts about nine times larger than the qubit linewidth. Our study demonstrates a compact integrated platform for continuous-variable quantum processing that combines large couplings, considerable relaxation times and excellent control over the photon mode structure in the microwave domain.},
